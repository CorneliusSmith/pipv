# PiPv's

A simple way to watch picture in picture videos (PiPv's) on ios 14 directly from the youtube app or safari.

# Why not just use a siri shortcut/ What is this app for

This app was primarily built as a tiny utility tool to workaround not being able to picture and picture in the youtube app.
It wasnt meant to replace shortcuts for the poeple that use it, it was only built to help me learn iOS development, as its a new hobby I decided to pick up.


# How to download/use

- Download iPA
- Sideload it using AltStore/Cydia impactor
- Open youtube app
- Hit Share 
- Hit the 3 dots if PiPv's doesnt show up and share to PiPv's
- Wait for video to load and go back to homescreen


# How to help

Enjoying my tiny utility app and want to help out? hit the link below and donate. Proceeds will go to furthuring development by:

- Purchasing a developers license
- Eventually updating my development machine to either a new Arm based one or one that doesnt hang when opening Xcode

# Possible Future Features

- Starting the video at the same position you left it (You'll have to manually scrub to your position for now)
- Once I have a dev license putting it up on testflight so it doesnt have to be sideloaded
